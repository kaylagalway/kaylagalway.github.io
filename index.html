  <h1>Kayla Galway</h1>
    <p>
    I am a software developer located in Brooklyn and in my free time you will find me playing roller derby, riding my bike, taking photos and attending tech meetups. I am a former professional photojournalist and now I sometimes photograph people giving birth.
    </p>
    <p>
    My career recently came full circle from photojournalism and I now work for the New York Times on their core newsreader iOS application. I also previously worked as a software developer at Showtime Networks for their iOS and tvOS video streaming applications, with a focus on the video player portion of the main application.  I was also lucky enough to be involved in the rapid fire development of the Mayweather vs. McGregor pay-per-view fight iOS/tvOS applications for Showtime, during which I worked on a little bit of everything with a very tight deadline.  I currently have over five professional applications published in the Apple App Store. Although I learned to develop for iOS in Objective-C, I currently primarily write in Swift.
