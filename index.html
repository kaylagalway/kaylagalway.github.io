  <h1>I am Kayla Galway</h1>
    <p>
    I am a software developer located in Brooklyn and in my free time you will find me playing roller derby, riding my bike, searching for the best Khao Soi and attending tech meetups. I am a former professional photojournalist and now I sometimes photograph people giving birth.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am currently an iOS Developer at Showtime Networks where I work on their iPhone, iPad and tvOS video streaming applications.  I have over five professional applications published in the Apple App Store. Although I learned to develop for iOS in Objective-C, I currently primarily write in Swift.

    <h4>A Brief History</h4>
    <p>
    I have a lot of interests and love learning new things, so I have worn a lot of hats, including: working as a photographer, managing a juice/coffee bar at a food co-op, organizing an environmentalist anti-hydrofracking compaign, and hiring/training a full canvassing staff to fundraise over $230,000. I studied Photojournalism at SUNY Albany and went on to work at the Berkshire Eagle and the Schenectady Gazette as a staff photojournalist.

    <p>
    When I started considering a change to a more technical career, I moved to Brooklyn and worked as a phone and computer technician at Apple for a couple of years.  While at Apple, I started learning Objective-C and got a fellowship with the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline to attend the iOS Development bootcamp at the Flatiron School in 2016.  After graduation, I worked at NYC Dev Shop and developed iOS applications for startups. At Showtime, I get to work on a lean three person team, which means I can fix bugs, work on new features, and create fresh applications from start to finish. I am constantly working on increasing my Cocoa knowledge in and outside of work while also learning more about languages I am less familiar with, like Python and Java.
